**<h1>İncesöz - Turkish Linguistic Analyzer</h1>** 

**İncesöz** is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to analyze the Turkish language. With its new, sleek design and methods for retrieving information, it’s a perfect fit for your Turkish linguistics studies. 

* İncesöz leverages many tools, datasets, and resources that were gathered from open-source outlets made specifically for Turkish, and it also includes new functionalities and methods that were prepared by **Enis Tuna** for this project: namely, the Rhyme Generator and Phonetic Transcriptor. [Phonetic Transcriptor](https://github.com/enistuna/Inceses) is also available as a Python package if you want to use it directly in your Python scripts.
* This project was first conceptualized in 2023, and the first demo was released the same year. It was then developed into a fully-functioning website in 2024. The project was initially hosted online but was later taken down. However, you can still access the full website through this GitHub repository.

Special thanks to **Özgün Koşaner** for his phonology advisory and to **Taner Sezer** for his help in publishing the Phonetic Transcriptor at the [Turkish Data Depository (TDD)](https://tools.tdd.ai).
