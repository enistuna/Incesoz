Namely, Rhyme Generator and Phonetic Transcriptor. [Phonetic Transcriptor](https://github.com/enistuna/inceses_turkish_phonetic_transcriptor) is also available as a Python package if you want to directly use it in your Python scripts.
* This project was first conceptitulized in 2023 and the first demo of it was released the same year. Then it was elaborated to be a fully-functioning website in 2024. At first, the project was being hosted on the internet but later was taken down. But you can still access the full website by this Github repository.
