**İncesöz** is an excellent website for anyone who wants to analyze the Turkish language. With its new, sleek design and methods for retrieving information, it’s a perfect fit for your Turkish linguistics studies. 

This project was planned, designed, coded, and published in *August 2024* by yours truly. At first, İncesöz v1.0 was hosted using PythonAnywhere's "Hacker" subscription plan, under the `www.incesöz.site` domain. However, it is no longer being hosted on the web. The website's main page layout is shown below. Feel free to check it out :)
